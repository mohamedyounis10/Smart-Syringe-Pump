A smart syringe pump system that operates via remote control over the internet using ESP32 and MQTT protocol. This project enables precise control over liquid volume and injection time with high accuracy.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Remote control via WiFi and MQTT
- ✅ Set liquid volume in milliliters (ML)
- ✅ Set injection time in seconds
- ✅ Automatic retraction after injection
- ✅ Real-time system status updates
- ✅ High precision stepper motor control

## 🔧 Hardware Components

### Required Components:
- **ESP32 Development Board** - Main microcontroller with WiFi capability
- **Stepper Motor** - For precise linear movement
- **Stepper Motor Driver** (Optional - depends on motor type)
- **Power Supply** - Appropriate power adapter
- **Jumper Wires** - For connections
- **Breadboard** (Optional) - For prototyping

### Motor Connections:
```
Motor Pin 1 → GPIO 26 (D26)
Motor Pin 2 → GPIO 25 (D25)
Motor Pin 3 → GPIO 33 (D33)
Motor Pin 4 → GPIO 32 (D32)
```

#### 1. Pump Structure
- [ ] Fixed base for the pump
- [ ] Stepper motor mount/holder
- [ ] Needle/tube mounting system

#### 2. Motion System
- [ ] Lead screw connected to the motor
- [ ] Moving platform to hold the syringe
- [ ] Linear guide to ensure straight movement

#### 3. Syringe System
- [ ] Adjustable syringe holder
- [ ] Syringe clamping mechanism
- [ ] Connection tube (optional)

#### 4. Safety and Stability

- **Speed Control**: Adjustable via settings

## 💻 Software Setup

### Software Requirements:
- Arduino IDE
- Required Arduino Libraries:
  - WiFi (Built-in)
  - PubSubClient
  - CustomStepper (Included in project)

### Setup Steps:

1. **Install Arduino IDE and ESP32 Board Support**
   ```
   File → Preferences → Additional Board Manager URLs
   Add: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
   ```

2. **Install PubSubClient Library**
   ```
   Tools → Manage Libraries → Search for "PubSubClient" → Install
   ```

3. **Configure WiFi and MQTT Settings**
   ```cpp
   const char* wifi_ssid = "Your_Network_Name";
   const char* wifi_password = "Your_Password";
   const char* mqtt_server = "test.mosquitto.org";
   ```

4. **Upload Code to ESP32**
   - Select Board: ESP32 Dev Module
   - Select appropriate Port
   - Click Upload

## 📡 MQTT Protocol

### Topics:

| Topic | Description | Data Type |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| `syringe/ml` | Set liquid volume in milliliters | Float |
| `syringe/time` | Set injection time in seconds | Float |
| `syringe/cmd` | Start command (`start` or `1`) | String |
| `syringe/status` | System status (read-only) | String |

### Usage Example:

```python
# Set volume
client.publish("syringe/ml", "5.0")  # 5 milliliters

# Set time
client.publish("syringe/time", "10.0")  # 10 seconds

# Start injection
client.publish("syringe/cmd", "start")
```

## ⚙️ Configurable Settings

In `script.ino` you can modify:

```cpp
const int STEPS_PER_ML = 3000;        // Steps per milliliter
const int RETRACT_SPEED_MICROS = 2000; // Retraction speed
```

## 🖥️ User Interface (UI)

The project is connected to a user interface for remote control of the pump.

### UI Features:
- Set liquid volume
- Set injection time
- Start/Stop button
- Real-time system status display
- Operation log
